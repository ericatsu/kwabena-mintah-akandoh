He asked the government to up its game in dealing with the situation because the country is not out of the difficulty yet.\n\nHe told journalists in Parliament on Thursday November 25 that “The attitude of government points to the fact that they are not serious to combat Covid-19 . We must know we are not out of the woods of Covid yet. In fact some countries are returning to lockdown.”\n\nOn Wednesday November 24 while speaking on the floor of Parliament, Mr Akandoh noted that the government had failed to meet its own target of vaccinating the targeted population.\n\nMr Akandoh said the government had so far managed to inoculate 2.5million people as of October 2021, a figure that is against the target of 17 million people for the same period.\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo had said during his address at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday September 22 that Ghana was working to reach the target of vaccinating twenty million people by the end of 2021.\n\n“Five million is not a figure to be sneered at, particularly when we consider the situation in many other African countries. We are grateful that our efforts at the management of the pandemic and vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo continued, “Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment.”\n\nBut Mr Akandoh who is also the Minority spokesperson on Health, said “Mr Speaker, it is a fact that as a country we have failed to vaccinate our people on time to meet the herd immunity.\n\n“Mr Speaker, I say so because the government presented to us a vaccination plan and this document is titled ‘ Covid-19 vaccination deployment and vaccination plan”.\n\nAccording to this document on page 29 we were supposed to have vaccinated about 1.5million people between April and June 2021. Again, from June to August we were supposed to have vaccinated about 6.3million . Between September to October we should have about 9.5million people . At this time we should have vaccinated not less than 17million people.\n\n“Ironically, if you refer to the 2022 budget we have vaccinated on 2.5million.

    "content": "RELEASE EXPEDITIOUSLY NHIL RECEIPTS INTO THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE FUND TO RESOLVE ITS CURRENT BANKRUPT FINANCIAL POSITION, PAY OUTSTANDING ARREARS AND COMPLY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE ACT.\n\nThe Minority in Parliament is outraged by the blatant disregard for the sustenance of the National Health Insurance Scheme by the Akufo-Addo-Bawumia-led administration which has resulted in its current bankrupt financial position. This gross and wanton neglect has driven the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) into a precarious financial state of comatose requiring intensive care services to save it from impending and inevitable collapse.\n\nIn an interview granted this morning by the Chief Executive Officer of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), Dr Dacosta Aboagye, on JoyNews’ AM show, he stated that since his appointment, “we are still waiting for them [Ministry of Finance] to do releases” to the authority.\n\nThis is quite worrying considering the fact that in that same interview he kept saying that the NHIA was in a robust financial position. How can the NHIA be in robust financial position if it had not received any releases since his appointment on the 28th of February 2024?\n\nIn fact, the NHIA is bankrupt because it has not received any releases from the Ministry of Finance this year. In addition, our checks at the Bank of Ghana shows that the National Health Insurance Fund has less than GHS1.0million. This a fund that is bankrupt to say the least.\n\nAlthough the members of the Bawumia-led Economic Management team while in opposition made several promises to improve on the National Health Insurance Scheme, they have at every turn put impediments previously unknown to the scheme since they assumed the reins of power.\n\nThe first major blow to hit the NHIS was the sponsoring of the Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act in 2017 by the Akufo-Addo Cabinet. This statute allowed them to operationalize their ulterior motive of diverting critical funds meant for the NHIS into the consolidated fund for projects and programs not approved by Parliament, like the National Cathedral Project, which has now become the most expensive hole in the world.\n\nThe operation of the Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act has denied the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) payments of over GHS6.0billion. These payments could have gone a long way to improve on the health of the fund and help expand its services to critical treatments like dialysis and cancer care, which currently are not covered by the scheme.\n\nAlso, according to the National Health Insurance Act (Act 852), Section 52(1), “The Minister responsible for Finance shall, within thirty days after collection of the levy, cause the levy to be paid directly into the fund and furnish the Minister responsible for Health and the Authority with evidence of the payment.”\n\nHowever, in flagrant disregard of this statute, the Minister responsible for Finance under the Bawumia-led economic management team places very little priority on the NHIS. While the Ministry collects the National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL) on almost all goods and services monthly as prescribed by law, it habitually delays even the meagre portions it has allocated of these receipts into the National Health Insurance Fund, leading to extended periods during which private health service providers decide not to attend to NHIS cardholders.\n\nIn a recent shameless charade to deceive Ghanaians, the Minister of Finance, after five months of not transferring a Cedi to the NHIS, issued a letter directing the Controller and Accountant General to transfer GHS2.4billion to the NHIF. This empty gesture, with no actual intention to make payments, was nothing less than gross official deception and has left the scheme in a state of insolvency.\n\nThe underfunding of the scheme has the potential to trigger epidemics such as measles and cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM), as witnessed in the 2022 and 2023, leading to increased morbidity and mortality among the Ghanaian residents. If the current situation persists with the government’s refusal to fund the NHIS, 2024 may see a resurgence of childhood diseases previously eradicated in Ghana. This outcome must be avoided at all costs.\n\nUnfortunately, the management of the National Health Insurance Authority has consistently failed in its fiduciary duty to ensure the viability of the fund. How can a CEO of a fund that has not received a transfer this year be out there granting interviews and claiming the fund is robust if not for the fact that he is a puppet being operated by Bawumia and company?\n\nThe NHIA management remained silent when the fund was capped in 2017 for no real logical reason.\n\nOver the years, they have allocated their meagre resources to exorbitant IT projects that have not yielded any real returns for the Scheme.\n\nAll these raise probing questions as to whether their primary duty is to protect and support the sustenance and improvement of the scheme or to cater to the political whims and caprices of the Bawumia-led economic management team, even if it means compromising the scheme’s integrity.\n\nThese combined factors of capping, zero transfers and a complicit or pliant management has compounded the already precarious financial position of the NHIS and contradicts the Akufo-Addo administration’s previous stance in opposition while exposes the Bawumia-led economic management team’s gross dereliction of attending to the health needs of Ghanaians.\n\nThe Bawumia-led economic management team must however take cognisance of the fact that the NHIS relies on the trust that the government will pay claims of subscribers when they fall due. Undermining this trust threatens the very existence of the fund as established by law.\n\nThe Minority therefore calls on the Bawumia-led Economic Management Team to direct the Minister responsible for Finance to release and transfer all outstanding payments to the National Health Insurance Fund by close of the week to prevent the scheme from being imperilled due to lack of funds.\n\nFurthermore, we urge the Minister responsible for Finance to  fully comply with the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act (Act 852), as non-compliance has clear consequences outlined in the Act.\n\nIn conclusion, the Minority assures all Ghanaians that we will not relent in our oversight responsibility of holding this government accountable. Ensuring that the needs of the average Ghanaian are met, including health, in a timely manner according to our statutes is our highest priority.\n\nThank you and may God bless you.\n\nKwabena Mintah Akandoh\n\n(MP for Juaboso and Ranking Member on the Parliamentary Select Committee on Health)",

We must know  we are not out of the woods of  Covid yet. In fact some countries  are returning to lockdown.”\n\nOn Wednesday November 24 while speaking on the floor of Parliament, Mr Akandoh noted that the government had failed to meet its own target of vaccinating the targeted population.\n\nMr Akandoh said the government had so far managed to inoculate 2.5million people as of October 2021, a figure that is against the target of 17 million people for the same period.\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo had said during his address at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday September 22 that Ghana was working to reach the target of vaccinating twenty million people by the end of 2021.\n\n“Five million is not a figure to be sneered at, particularly when we consider the situation in many other African countries. We are grateful that our efforts at the management of the pandemic and vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo continued, “Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment.”\n\nBut Mr Akandoh who is also the Minority spokesperson on Health, said “Mr Speaker, it is a fact that as a country we have failed to vaccinate our people on time to meet the herd immunity.\n\n“Mr Speaker, I say so because the government presented to us a vaccination plan and this document is titled ‘ Covid-19 vaccination deployment and vaccination plan”.\n\nAccording to this document on page 29 we were supposed to have vaccinated about 1.5million people between April and June 2021. Again, from June to August we were supposed to have vaccinated about 6.3million . Between September to October we should have about 9.5million people .  At this time we should have vaccinated not less than 17million people.\n\n“Ironically, if you refer to the 2022 budget we have vaccinated on 2.5million. Per their own marking scheme, 2.5 divided 17 is an obvious fail.”\n\nBy Laud Nartey|3news.com|Ghana",

We are grateful that our efforts at the management of the pandemic and vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo continued, “Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment.”\n\nBut contributing to a debate on the 2022 budget statement in Parliament on Wednesday November 24, Mr Akandoh who is also the Minority spokesperson on Health, said “Mr Speaker, it is a fact that as a country we have failed to vaccinate our people on time  to meet the herd immunity. Mr Speaker, I say so because  the government presented to us a vaccination plan  and this document is titled ‘ Covid-19 vaccination  deployment and vaccination plan’.\n\nAccording to this document  on page 29  we were supposed to have vaccinated  about 1.5million  people between  April and June 2021. Again,  from June to August we were supposed  to have vaccinated about  6.3million . Between September  to October we should have  about 9.5million  people  . At this time  we should have vaccinated not less than  17million  people.\n\n“Ironically, if you refer to the 2022 budget we have vaccinated on  2.5million.

      "“Some of the things they buy, they don’t even need them, and now they want to be buying fuel, which is not even their core duty, all these are reasons the finances aren’t adding up,” he said.",

Why would any rational and reasonable IGP transfer a district commander from a district command to a quarter master stores 8 days to an election?” he quizzed.\n\nHe added, “I have come to a clear conclusion that anybody in this country who attempts to believe the IGP, Dr. Akuffo Dampare, you do that at your own peril.\n\n“He preaches as though he is an angel in the social media space for people to see him as white, but these are some of the things he is doing in the country.\n\nAkandoh emphasized that despite conducting himself responsibly throughout his years of contesting elections, the actions of the IGP raise obvious concerns. He criticized the immediate implementation of the district police commander’s transfer, noting that the letter took effect the same day it was issued, leaving room for reasonable speculation.\n\n“I’m referring to what he has just done in the Juaboso district and for your information, the message came with a clear instruction that the transfer was to take effect from  the same day the message came. So clearly, every reasonable bystander will be able to read a lot of meanings into it. But we in Juaboso are for peace,” he stated.",

He asked the government to up its game in dealing with the situation because the country is not out of the difficulty yet.\n\nHe told journalists in Parliament on Thursday November 25 that “The attitude of government points to the fact that they are not serious to combat Covid-19 . We must know we are not out of the woods of Covid yet. In fact some countries are returning to lockdown.”\n\nOn Wednesday November 24 while speaking on the floor of Parliament, Mr Akandoh noted that the government had failed to meet its own target of vaccinating the targeted population.\n\nMr Akandoh said the government had so far managed to inoculate 2.5million people as of October 2021, a figure that is against the target of 17 million people for the same period.\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo had said during his address at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday September 22 that Ghana was working to reach the target of vaccinating twenty million people by the end of 2021.\n\n“Five million is not a figure to be sneered at, particularly when we consider the situation in many other African countries. We are grateful that our efforts at the management of the pandemic and vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo continued, “Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment.”\n\nBut Mr Akandoh who is also the Minority spokesperson on Health, said “Mr Speaker, it is a fact that as a country we have failed to vaccinate our people on time to meet the herd immunity.\n\n“Mr Speaker, I say so because the government presented to us a vaccination plan and this document is titled ‘ Covid-19 vaccination deployment and vaccination plan”.\n\nAccording to this document on page 29 we were supposed to have vaccinated about 1.5million people between April and June 2021. Again, from June to August we were supposed to have vaccinated about 6.3million . Between September to October we should have about 9.5million people . At this time we should have vaccinated not less than 17million people.\n\n“Ironically, if you refer to the 2022 budget we have vaccinated on 2.5million.

    "content": "RELEASE EXPEDITIOUSLY NHIL RECEIPTS INTO THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE FUND TO RESOLVE ITS CURRENT BANKRUPT FINANCIAL POSITION, PAY OUTSTANDING ARREARS AND COMPLY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE ACT.\n\nThe Minority in Parliament is outraged by the blatant disregard for the sustenance of the National Health Insurance Scheme by the Akufo-Addo-Bawumia-led administration which has resulted in its current bankrupt financial position. This gross and wanton neglect has driven the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) into a precarious financial state of comatose requiring intensive care services to save it from impending and inevitable collapse.\n\nIn an interview granted this morning by the Chief Executive Officer of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), Dr Dacosta Aboagye, on JoyNews’ AM show, he stated that since his appointment, “we are still waiting for them [Ministry of Finance] to do releases” to the authority.\n\nThis is quite worrying considering the fact that in that same interview he kept saying that the NHIA was in a robust financial position. How can the NHIA be in robust financial position if it had not received any releases since his appointment on the 28th of February 2024?\n\nIn fact, the NHIA is bankrupt because it has not received any releases from the Ministry of Finance this year. In addition, our checks at the Bank of Ghana shows that the National Health Insurance Fund has less than GHS1.0million. This a fund that is bankrupt to say the least.\n\nAlthough the members of the Bawumia-led Economic Management team while in opposition made several promises to improve on the National Health Insurance Scheme, they have at every turn put impediments previously unknown to the scheme since they assumed the reins of power.\n\nThe first major blow to hit the NHIS was the sponsoring of the Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act in 2017 by the Akufo-Addo Cabinet. This statute allowed them to operationalize their ulterior motive of diverting critical funds meant for the NHIS into the consolidated fund for projects and programs not approved by Parliament, like the National Cathedral Project, which has now become the most expensive hole in the world.\n\nThe operation of the Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act has denied the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) payments of over GHS6.0billion. These payments could have gone a long way to improve on the health of the fund and help expand its services to critical treatments like dialysis and cancer care, which currently are not covered by the scheme.\n\nAlso, according to the National Health Insurance Act (Act 852), Section 52(1), “The Minister responsible for Finance shall, within thirty days after collection of the levy, cause the levy to be paid directly into the fund and furnish the Minister responsible for Health and the Authority with evidence of the payment.”\n\nHowever, in flagrant disregard of this statute, the Minister responsible for Finance under the Bawumia-led economic management team places very little priority on the NHIS. While the Ministry collects the National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL) on almost all goods and services monthly as prescribed by law, it habitually delays even the meagre portions it has allocated of these receipts into the National Health Insurance Fund, leading to extended periods during which private health service providers decide not to attend to NHIS cardholders.\n\nIn a recent shameless charade to deceive Ghanaians, the Minister of Finance, after five months of not transferring a Cedi to the NHIS, issued a letter directing the Controller and Accountant General to transfer GHS2.4billion to the NHIF. This empty gesture, with no actual intention to make payments, was nothing less than gross official deception and has left the scheme in a state of insolvency.\n\nThe underfunding of the scheme has the potential to trigger epidemics such as measles and cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM), as witnessed in the 2022 and 2023, leading to increased morbidity and mortality among the Ghanaian residents. If the current situation persists with the government’s refusal to fund the NHIS, 2024 may see a resurgence of childhood diseases previously eradicated in Ghana. This outcome must be avoided at all costs.\n\nUnfortunately, the management of the National Health Insurance Authority has consistently failed in its fiduciary duty to ensure the viability of the fund. How can a CEO of a fund that has not received a transfer this year be out there granting interviews and claiming the fund is robust if not for the fact that he is a puppet being operated by Bawumia and company?\n\nThe NHIA management remained silent when the fund was capped in 2017 for no real logical reason.\n\nOver the years, they have allocated their meagre resources to exorbitant IT projects that have not yielded any real returns for the Scheme.\n\nAll these raise probing questions as to whether their primary duty is to protect and support the sustenance and improvement of the scheme or to cater to the political whims and caprices of the Bawumia-led economic management team, even if it means compromising the scheme’s integrity.\n\nThese combined factors of capping, zero transfers and a complicit or pliant management has compounded the already precarious financial position of the NHIS and contradicts the Akufo-Addo administration’s previous stance in opposition while exposes the Bawumia-led economic management team’s gross dereliction of attending to the health needs of Ghanaians.\n\nThe Bawumia-led economic management team must however take cognisance of the fact that the NHIS relies on the trust that the government will pay claims of subscribers when they fall due. Undermining this trust threatens the very existence of the fund as established by law.\n\nThe Minority therefore calls on the Bawumia-led Economic Management Team to direct the Minister responsible for Finance to release and transfer all outstanding payments to the National Health Insurance Fund by close of the week to prevent the scheme from being imperilled due to lack of funds.\n\nFurthermore, we urge the Minister responsible for Finance to  fully comply with the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act (Act 852), as non-compliance has clear consequences outlined in the Act.\n\nIn conclusion, the Minority assures all Ghanaians that we will not relent in our oversight responsibility of holding this government accountable. Ensuring that the needs of the average Ghanaian are met, including health, in a timely manner according to our statutes is our highest priority.\n\nThank you and may God bless you.\n\nKwabena Mintah Akandoh\n\n(MP for Juaboso and Ranking Member on the Parliamentary Select Committee on Health)",

    "content": "Juaboso Member of Parliament, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh has said the government’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic has not been the best.\n\nHe asked the government to up its game in dealing with the situation because the country is not out of the difficulty yet.\n\nHe told journalists in Parliament on Thursday November 25 that “The attitude of government points to the fact that they are not serious  to combat Covid-19 . We must know  we are not out of the woods of  Covid yet. In fact some countries  are returning to lockdown.”\n\nOn Wednesday November 24 while speaking on the floor of Parliament, Mr Akandoh noted that the government had failed to meet its own target of vaccinating the targeted population.\n\nMr Akandoh said the government had so far managed to inoculate 2.5million people as of October 2021, a figure that is against the target of 17 million people for the same period.\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo had said during his address at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday September 22 that Ghana was working to reach the target of vaccinating twenty million people by the end of 2021.\n\n“Five million is not a figure to be sneered at, particularly when we consider the situation in many other African countries. We are grateful that our efforts at the management of the pandemic and vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo continued, “Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment.”\n\nBut Mr Akandoh who is also the Minority spokesperson on Health, said “Mr Speaker, it is a fact that as a country we have failed to vaccinate our people on time to meet the herd immunity.\n\n“Mr Speaker, I say so because the government presented to us a vaccination plan and this document is titled ‘ Covid-19 vaccination deployment and vaccination plan”.\n\nAccording to this document on page 29 we were supposed to have vaccinated about 1.5million people between April and June 2021. Again, from June to August we were supposed to have vaccinated about 6.3million . Between September to October we should have about 9.5million people .  At this time we should have vaccinated not less than 17million people.\n\n“Ironically, if you refer to the 2022 budget we have vaccinated on 2.5million. Per their own marking scheme, 2.5 divided 17 is an obvious fail.”\n\nBy Laud Nartey|3news.com|Ghana",

    "content": "Juaboso lawmaker, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh has called for the interdiction of the ambulance crew following the the death of the nursing mother who was being transferred from Takoradi to Accra on referral.\n\nFollowing the death of the woman, the husband John Obiri Yeboah, accused personnel of the National Ambulance Service of  gross unprofessionalism, leading to the death of his wife.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday January 12, Mr Mintah Akandoh said “We will never leave this matter, we will pursue this matter  to its logical conclusion. So far, we have listen to the family, we have listen tp the facility for the referral. There are  more questions  than  answers that have been provided so far.\n\n“So,  for me, even at this hour  if the ambulance driver and the crew  are interdicted pending investigation that wont be bad at all.”\n\nMeanwhile, Head of Public Relations at the National Ambulance Service (NAS) Simon Yousiff Kewura says the Service cannot be blamed for the death of the nursing mother being transferred from Takoradi to Accra on referral.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Nhyiraba Paa Kwesi Simpson on Connect FM’s Omanbapa morning show, Mr. Yousif Kewura revealed that a disagreement between nurses and a doctor at the Holy Child Hospital Fijai in Sekondi-Takoradi might have caused the delay, which perhaps led to the death of the patient.\n\nNarrating events leading to the death of his wife on Connect FM’s morning show, Mr Obiri Yeboah explained to the host that his wife successfully underwent surgery on Tuesday, January 4 at the Holy Child Hospital.\n\nHe had gone home and was preparing food for the wife when he received a call from his wife’s sister that his wife had suffered a complication and was to be transferred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra.\n\nBut Mr. Obiri Yeboah said the Ambulance Service officials demanded an amount of GH¢600 to enable them buy fuel.\n\nHe explained that the officials caused undue delay with their demand for the money.\n\n“Whilst on our way to Accra, the [National] Ambulance Service personnel stopped and asked me to bring an amount of GH¢600 for fuel. I had only GH¢150 on me then, they took GH¢50 and bought the fuel. Right after buying the fuel, they returned to Takoradi whilst my wife was suffering,” he narrated.\n\nBut the NAS PRO insisted the Service cannot be blamed for the death.\n\n“We were called by the hospital to convey the patient to Korle Bu. The hospital told us that the husband of the patient will pay the cost of the fuel. We wanted to buy the fuel along the way but the husband of the patient did not have the money.\n\n“At the same time the hospital called and asked us to return and take the baby she delivered along. After getting to the hospital, there was a heated argument between the nurse and the doctor and that  caused the delay and the subsequent death of the patient, so we cannot be blamed,” he stated.\n\nSource: 3news.com|Ghana",

So far, we have listen to the family, we have listen tp the facility for the referral. There are  more questions  than  answers that have been provided so far.",
      "“So,  for me, even at this hour  if the ambulance driver and the crew  are interdicted pending investigation that wont be bad at all.”",
      "Meanwhile, Head of Public Relations at the National Ambulance Service (NAS) Simon Yousiff Kewura says the Service cannot be blamed for the death of the nursing mother being transferred from Takoradi to Accra on referral.",
      "Speaking in an interview with Nhyiraba Paa Kwesi Simpson on Connect FM’s Omanbapa morning show, Mr. Yousif Kewura revealed that a disagreement between nurses and a doctor at the Holy Child Hospital Fijai in Sekondi-Takoradi might have caused the delay, which perhaps led to the death of the patient.",
      "Narrating events leading to the death of his wife on Connect FM’s morning show, Mr Obiri Yeboah explained to the host that his wife successfully underwent surgery on Tuesday, January 4 at the Holy Child Hospital.",
      "He had gone home and was preparing food for the wife when he received a call from his wife’s sister that his wife had suffered a complication and was to be transferred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra.",
      "But Mr. Obiri Yeboah said the Ambulance Service officials demanded an amount of GH¢600 to enable them buy fuel.",
      "He explained that the officials caused undue delay with their demand for the money.",
      "“Whilst on our way to Accra, the [National] Ambulance Service personnel stopped and asked me to bring an amount of GH¢600 for fuel. I had only GH¢150 on me then, they took GH¢50 and bought the fuel. Right after buying the fuel, they returned to Takoradi whilst my wife was suffering,” he narrated.",
      "But the NAS PRO insisted the Service cannot be blamed for the death.",
      "“We were called by the hospital to convey the patient to Korle Bu. The hospital told us that the husband of the patient will pay the cost of the fuel. We wanted to buy the fuel along the way but the husband of the patient did not have the money.",
      "“At the same time the hospital called and asked us to return and take the baby she delivered along. After getting to the hospital, there was a heated argument between the nurse and the doctor and that  caused the delay and the subsequent death of the patient, so we cannot be blamed,” he stated.",

    "content": "The Ranking Member on the Health Committee of Parliament, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has reiterated his stance on the government’s inability to fund the ambitious Agenda 111 hospital project.\n\nHe alleged that government has rendered the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) bankrupt.\n\nHis comments follow a press statement by the Minority in Parliament, highlighting the dire financial situation of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) under the current administration.\n\nHe challenged claims by the government to have commissioned 50 hospitals out of the 111, asserting that this number is unrealistic given the financial constraints.\n\nAccording to Akandoh, the government’s inability to sustain NHIS rendered it bankrupt, thus speaking volumes to the government “not even having the money for Agenda 111.” He alleged that promises made regarding the construction of 111 hospitals would not materialise due to lack of funds.\n\n“The President told the good people of Ghana that before January 2025 he will hand over 111 hospitals, even the 50 they are promising, they don’t even have the money, there is no money for Agenda 111.\n\n“Right from day one that the NPP promised Agenda 111, I told Ghanaians there will be no 111 hospitals in Ghana, they called me all sorts of names including prophet of doom among others. It is all politics, the NPP does not respect Ghanaians, they think they are smarter than Ghanaians, they are always looking for the political capital that is all they are looking for,” Mr Akandoh stated.\n\nSpeaking on Yen Nsempa hosted by Nana Yaa Brefo and co-hosted by Isaac Ekow JB on Onua FM, May 26, Akandoh criticised the government’s approach to healthcare, accusing the administration of “prioritising political gains over the welfare of Ghanaians.”\n\nFurthermore, Akandoh warned against the potential consequences of the NPP and its Flagbearer Mahamadu Bawumia hastily commissioning hospitals without adequate equipment and resources to make the situation temporarily go away ahead of the 2024 general elections, suggesting that such facilities may not be fully operational or beneficial to patients.\n\n“They will wait until elections and pretend to be doing something, very soon Vice President Dr Bawumia will be going round one place to another commissioning like 10 hospitals and then tell Ghanaians the rest are in various stages  of completion.\n\n“Even the 10 I’m mentioning, they will do a caricature move and commission facilities no patients can use because there might be no equipment in there, take it from me, they will close such facilities again,” he said.\n\nLois Dogbe",
